# Encontra

Encontra '26 is an offline Wikipedia browser for [SymbOS](http://symbos.org), inspired by the classic Microsoft Encarta series of CD-ROM encyclopedias. All 50,000 Wikipedia Level 5 Vital Articles are included, plus about 1,000 additional articles relating to computer history and specific vintage hardware/software. A tabbed reading interface with hyperlinks is provided for maximum wiki-rabbit-hole enjoyment. (Ctrl+Click opens a link in a new tab.)
